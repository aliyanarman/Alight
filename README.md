## The Problem

You’re in a meeting. Someone’s talking IRR, MOIC, EBITDA multiples. You nod. Inside, you’re doing math on your feet, trying not to sound clueless.

Or you run multiple companies. You don’t have time to open Excel, pull comps across industries and countries, adjust for context, build forecasts, and double-check formulas just to answer one question: is this deal good or garbage?

Alight gives you institutional grade analysis in seconds. It researches comparable transactions, cites real deals , discusses market risks (taxes, currency volatility), and writes in the language your investors expect. All of that under a minute.

## How It Works

Pick an industry. Pick a country. Enter your numbers. Hit calculate.

The math happens instantly. Alight thinks for a second and voila, you get your answer with context about what typically happens in your industry, in your market, with deals like this.

If you're in tech in Pakistan, you'll see that 25-35% growth is possible but power outages are a risk.  
If you're in retail in the UK, you'll learn that high street stores are dying and 3% growth is the norm.  
If you're buying a healthcare business in the UAE, you'll hear that medical tourism is booming and expats pay well.

A 20% return in the US is great. In Pakistan, it's just okay (25% is the target because of inflation and risk). Alight adjusts for your market.
It learns from history. Alight will tell you if a similar deal crashed in your market. WeWork thought it was a tech company. Theranos couldn't deliver. Alight remembers so you don't have to.

It's wonderful.
